    "3.9 Newton’s method for finding square roots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an approximate answer and iteratively improving it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, before we had calculators or computers, people needed to calculate square roots manually. Newton used a particularly good method (there is some evidence that this method was known many years before). Suppose that you want to know the square root of n. If you start with almost any approximation, you can compute a better approximation (closer to the actual answer) with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "`better = (approx + n/approx)/2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat this calculation a few times using your calculator. Can you see why each iteration brings your estimate a little closer? One of the amazing properties of this particular algorithm is how quickly it converges to an accurate answer — a great advantage for doing it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a loop and repeating this formula until the better approximation gets close enough to the previous one, we can write a function for computing the square root. (In fact, this is how your calculator finds square roots — it may have a slightly different formula and method, but it is also based on repeatedly improving its guesses.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an indefinite iteration problem: we cannot predict in advance how many times we’ll want to improve our guess — we just want to keep getting closer and closer. Our stopping condition for the loop will be when our old guess and our improved guess are “close enough” to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we’d like the old and new guess to be exactly equal to each other when we stop. But exact equality is a tricky notion in computer arithmetic when real numbers are involved. Because real numbers are not represented absolutely accurately (after all, a number like pi or the square root of two has an infinite number of decimal places because it is irrational), we need to formulate the stopping test for the loop by asking “is a close enough to b”? This stopping condition can be coded like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Make this smaller for better accuracy\n",
